<h2>Computer Algebra Systems using Java</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/" target="rela">jscl-meditor</a>
    Java symbolic computing library and mathematical editor.
    The goal of this project is to provide a Java symbolic computing library 
    and a mathematical editor acting as a front-end to the former. 
    There are several computer algebra systems available on the market, 
    most of them developed in other languages, mainly C/C++ and Lisp. 
    But the benefits of using Java in symbolic computation are great. 
    Aside from being widely used and to comply with various standards, 
    this language has two features of concern: readability and portability.

    <a href="http://www.matheclipse.org" target="rela">MathEclipse</a>
    is a Java Computer Algebra system. MathEclipse has functions for 
    arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, matrices, vectors, finite sets, 
    derivatives, pattern-matching rewriting rules and functional programming.

<li><p>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/symja/" target="rela">Symja</a> -
    a symbolic math system written in Java based on the MathEclipse libraries.
    Features: arbitrary precision integers, rationals and complex numbers, 
    polynomials, differentiation, pattern matching and linear algebra.

<li><p> 
    <a href="http://www.geogebra.org" target="rela">GeoGebra</a>
    is dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that joins
    arithmetic, geometry, algebra and calculus. On the one hand, GeoGebra
    is an interactive geometry system. You can do constructions with
    points, vectors, segments, lines, conic sections as well as functions
    and change them dynamically afterwards. On the other hand, equations
    and coordinates can be entered directly. Thus, GeoGebra has the
    ability to deal with variables for numbers, vectors and points, finds
    derivatives and integrals of functions and offers commands like Root
    or Extremum. These two views are characteristic of GeoGebra: an
    expression in the algebra view corresponds to an object in the
    graphics view and vice versa.

    <a href="http://webuser.hs-furtwangen.de/~dersch/" target="rela">Jasymca</a>: 
    Programmable Java calculator. CAS (Computer Algebra System), 
    provides exact and symbolic datatypes, interactive graphics display of functions. 
    The user interface can be selected from either a Matlab/Octave/SciLab-style, 
    or a GNU-Maxima-style. 
    Runs on any Java SE- and ME-platform: Windows, MacOS, Linux, Cellphone, PDA and others.

    <a href="http://woody.cs.wichita.edu/gex/gex.html" target="rela">JGEX</a>: 
    Java Geometry Expert is an ongoing developing system which initially began in 
    early 2004 in Wichita State Univerisity. JGEX is a system which combines 
    our approach for visually dynamic presentation of proofs (VDDP), 
    dynamic geometry software (DGS), automated geometry theorem prover (GTP).
    The VDDP part is the most distinctive part of JGEX. It is based on our work 
    on DGS and GTP. JGEX can be used to create proofs either manually and automatically. 
    It provides a seris of visual effects for presenting of these proofs. 
    With the applet version of JGEX, the user may create beautiful examples 
    and put them on the web to share with others

<h2>Computer Algebra Systems using other Object Oriented Programing Languages</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="rela">Sage</a>
    is an Open Source Mathematics Software
    creating a viable free open source alternative to
    Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. 
    Sage is written in Python and Cython as an interface to 
    other open source CAS Singular, PARI/GP, GAP, gnuplot, Magma, and Maple.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/" target="rela">SymPy</a>
    is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
    It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) 
    while keeping the code as simple as possible in order 
    to be comprehensible and easily extensible. 
    SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.ginac.de/" target="rela">GiNaC</a>
    has been developed to become a replacement engine for xloops which 
    in the past was powered by the Maple CAS. Its design is revolutionary 
    in a sense that contrary to other CAS it does not try to 
    provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a simple programming language 
    but instead accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by a 
    set of algebraic capabilities.
    The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for 
    GiNaC is Not a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. 
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/~peekas/cadabra/" target="rela">Cadabra</a>
    is a computer algebra system (CAS) designed specifically for the 
    solution of problems encountered in field theory.
    It has extensive functionality for tensor polynomial simplification 
    including multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables, 
    Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence, 
    multiple index types and many more. 
    The input format is a subset of TeX. 
    Both a command-line and a graphical interface are available.
